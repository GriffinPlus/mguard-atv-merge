## Status

**This project is under active development and should not be used in production, yet.**

At the moment only the application frame is there, no business logic. Stay tuned!

## Overview and Motivation

The *mGuard* security router series is a family of firewall/router devices that is produced by the PHOENIX CONTACT
Cyber Security AG, a member of the [PHOENIX CONTACT group](https://www.phoenixcontact.com/). An *mGuard* in connection
with the [mGuard Secure Cloud](https://us.cloud.mguard.com/) can be used for remote servicing machines in the field
via IPSec-VPN.

Setting up an *mGuard* in the *mGuard Secure Cloud* generates a configuration file containing everything that is needed
to connect to the cloud. The configuration file can then be loaded into the *mGuard* to set it up properly. As a
configuration file is a snapshot of all settings, loading a configuration file replaces existing settings in the
*mGuard*. Therefore it is not possible to have custom settings along with the configuration file generated by the
cloud.

The idea of *mGuard-ATV-Merge* is to merge two configuration files (file extension: `.atv`) into one containing
everything - the static custom settings and dynamic settings like parameters specific to the VPN setup. The merge
process is configurable, so *mGuard-ATV-Merge* can be used to merge *mGuard* configuration files in general.

## Releases

*mGuard-ATV-Merge* is written in GO which makes it highly portable.
