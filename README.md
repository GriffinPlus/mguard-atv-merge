## Status

**This project is under active development and should not be used in production, yet.**

## Overview and Motivation

The *mGuard* security router series is a family of firewall/router devices that is produced by the PHOENIX CONTACT
Cyber Security AG, a member of the [PHOENIX CONTACT group](https://www.phoenixcontact.com/). An *mGuard* in connection
with the [mGuard Secure Cloud](https://us.cloud.mguard.com/) can be used for remote servicing machines in the field
via IPSec-VPN.

Setting up an *mGuard* in the *mGuard Secure Cloud* generates a configuration file containing everything that is needed
to connect to the cloud. The configuration file can then be loaded into the *mGuard* to set it up properly. As a
configuration file is a snapshot of all settings, loading a configuration file replaces existing settings in the
*mGuard*. Therefore it is not possible to have custom settings along with the configuration file generated by the
cloud. A tool that is able to merge two configurations into one would be handy. This is where the *mGuard-Config-Tool*
comes into play.

The *mGuard-Config-Tool* aims to ease handling *mGuard* configuration files. It's main features are:

- Support for ATV files and (unencrypted) ECS containers
- Tasks
  - User Management: Add users and set/verify passwords
  - Conditioning: Condition a configuration and convert formats (ATV <=> ECS)
  - Merging: Merge two configurations into one
- On Windows: Service for merging configurations and creating update packages

## Releases

*mGuard-Config-Tool* is written in GO which makes it highly portable.

[Downloads](https://github.com/GriffinPlus/mguard-config-tool/releases) are provided for the following combinations of
popular target operating systems and platforms:

- Linux
  - Intel x86 Platform (`386`)
  - Intel x64 Platform (`amd64`)
  - ARM 32-bit Platform (`arm`)
  - ARM 64-bit Platform (`arm64`)
- Windows
  - Intel x86 Platform (`386`)
  - Intel x64 Platform (`amd64`)

If any other target operating system and/or platform is needed and the combination is supported by GO, please open an
issue and we'll add support for it.

## Usage

The *mGuard-Config-Tool* is a console application that uses subcommands to run different tasks. The application writes
log messages to *stderr*, so it's easy to pipe them into a log file or discard them entirely. The *stdout* channel is
used for emitting content only.

### Subcommand: user

The `user` subcommand provides access to the user management. All operations run on ECS files only, but support an
implicit conversion if an ATV file is specified. ATV files do not contain information about user accounts and
passwords. By default the ECS container to work on is expected to be passed via *stdin* to ease scripting without
generating temporary files. The output of these operations is an ECS container that is written to *stdout*.
Optionally input and output can be regular files as well by specifying `--ecs-in` and `--ecs-out` appropriately.

```
user - Add user and set/verify user passwords (ECS containers only).

  Usage:
        user [add|password]

  Subcommands:
    add        Add a user.
    password   Set or verify the password of a user.

  Flags:
       --version   Displays the program version string.
    -h --help      Displays help with available flag, subcommand, and positional value parameters.
       --verbose   Include additional messages that might help when problems occur.
```

The subcommand `user add` allows to add new users:

```
add - Add a user.

  Usage:
        add [username] [password]

  Positional Variables:
        username   Login name of the user. (Required)
        password   Password of the user. (Required)

  Flags:
       --version   Displays the program version string.
    -h --help      Displays help with available flag, subcommand, and positional value parameters.
       --ecs-in    The ECS container (instead of stdin).
       --ecs-out   File receiving the updated ECS container (instead of stdout).
       --verbose   Include additional messages that might help when problems occur.
```

The subcommand `user password set` sets the password of a user.

```
set - Set the password a user (ECS containers only).

  Usage:
        set [username] [password]

  Positional Variables:
        username   Login name of the user. (Required)
        password   Password of the user. (Required)

  Flags:
       --version   Displays the program version string.
    -h --help      Displays help with available flag, subcommand, and positional value parameters.
       --ecs-in    The ECS container (instead of stdin).
       --ecs-out   File receiving the updated ECS container (instead of stdout).
       --verbose   Include additional messages that might help when problems occur.
```

The subcommand `user password verify` verifys the password of a user. Depending on the outcome of the verification the
exit code can be one of the following:

- 0 : The specified password is correct.
- 1 : The specified password is not correct.
- any other : An error occurred.

```
verify - Verify the password of a user (ECS containers only).

  Usage:
        verify [username] [password]

  Positional Variables:
        username   Login name of the user. (Required)
        password   Password of the user. (Required)

  Flags:
       --version   Displays the program version string.
    -h --help      Displays help with available flag, subcommand, and positional value parameters.
       --ecs-in    The ECS container (instead of stdin).
       --verbose   Include additional messages that might help when problems occur.
```

### Subcommand: condition

The `condition` subcommand provides access to conditioning and conversion. *Conditioning* takes a configuration file,
parses the configuration and writes the configuration properly formatted. *Conversion* actually conditions a
configuration and writes it using a different format (ATV or ECS). This way an ATV file that was originally created for
use with the mGuard web interface can be converted to an ECS file that can be used to configure an mGuard via SDCard
and vice versa.

By default the ECS container to work on is expected to be passed via *stdin* to ease scripting without generating
temporary files. The output of the operation is an ECS container that is written to *stdout*. Optionally input and
output can be regular files as well by specifying `--ecs-in`, `--ecs-out` and `--atv-out` appropriately.

If an ATV file is passed in and an ECS container is written the conditioned ATV file is stored in the ECS container and
the missing parts in the ECS container are initialized with defaults. The defaults are the same a new mGuard comes with.
If an ECS container is passwd in and an ATV file is written, the configuration stored in the ECS container is simply
extracted and saved as an ATV file.

```
condition - Condition and/or convert a mGuard configuration file

  Flags:
       --version   Displays the program version string.
    -h --help      Displays help with available flag, subcommand, and positional value parameters.
       --in        File containing the mGuard configuration to condition (ATV format or ECS container)
       --atv-out   File receiving the conditioned configuration (ATV format, instead of stdout)
       --ecs-out   File receiving the conditioned configuration (ECS container, instead of stdout)
       --verbose   Include additional messages that might help when problems occur.
```

### Subcommand: merge

The `merge` subcommand merges two configuration files into one. The first specified file is taken as the base for the
result, then the configuration stored in the second file is "stacked" upon the first configuration. Simple values and
complex values are overwritten and table values (lists) are merged by appending all rows in a table in the second
configuration to the corresponding table in the first configuration. If the first file is an ATV file, it is implicitly
converted to an ECS file first. Therefore the resulting ECS container contains default settings for all elements except
the encorporated mGuard configuration (`/aca/cfg`).

By default the output of the operation is an ECS container that is written to *stdout*. The output can be written to
a regular file as well by specifying `--ecs-out` and `--atv-out` appropriately.

```
merge - Merge two mGuard configuration files into one

  Usage:
	merge [1st-file] [2nd-file]

  Positional Variables: 
	1st-file   First configuration file to merge (Required)
	2nd-file   Second configuration file to merge (Required)

  Flags: 
       --version   Displays the program version string.
    -h --help      Displays help with available flag, subcommand, and positional value parameters.
       --atv-out   File receiving the merged configuration (ATV format, instead of stdout)
       --ecs-out   File receiving the merged configuration (ECS container, instead of stdout)
       --verbose   Include additional messages that might help when problems occur.
```

### Subcommand: service \*\***WINDOWS ONLY**\*\*

The `service` subcommand provides access to the *Configuration Preparation Service* (CPS). The CPS is part of the
*mGuard-Config-Tool*, stays in the background and monitors a specific directory for ATV/ECS files (hot-folder technique).
As soon as a new ATV/ECS file is dropped into the hot-folder, the service merges a specific mGuard base configuration with
the dropped configuration and generates ATV/ECS files with the merged configuration. Furthermore the service generates a
zip file containing everything that is needed to flash a specific firmware and to load an initial configuration into a
mGuard device. This is particularly useful when preparing mGuards in production and allows to run (and update) the
*mGuard-Config-Tool* on a server. By default the service is registered to run as `LocalSystem` which means that it runs
with administrative rights on the machine it is installed on. This ensures that you do not run into permission issues when
running it locally, but you are strongly encouraged to create a service account with the minimum rights the service needs
to access the configured directories. This step is also required when working with shared folders on a network as
`LocalSystem` is often not allowed to access file shares.

The `install` and `uninstall` subcommand installs respectively uninstalls the *mGuard-Config-Tool* as a windows service.
The `start` and `stop` subcommands communicate with the Service Control Manager (SCM) to start/stop the installed service.
As for all services, the usual service control panel (`services.msc`) can also be used. The `debug` subcommand runs the
service without installation and is used for debugging purposes only.

```
service - Controls the mGuard configuration merging service

  Usage:
	service [install|uninstall|start|stop|debug]

  Subcommands: 
    install     Install the windows service
    uninstall   Uninstall the windows service
    start       Start the installed windows service
    stop        Stop the installed windows service
    debug       Run as a command line application for debugging purposes

  Flags: 
       --version   Displays the program version string.
    -h --help      Displays help with available flag, subcommand, and positional value parameters.
       --verbose   Include additional messages that might help when problems occur.
```

The service can be configured using a YAML configuration file that is expected beside `mguard-config-tool.exe`. It must
be named `mguard-config-tool.yaml`. The default configuration is generated in the first run, if permissions allow that.
The default configuration file looks like the following:

```yaml
input:
  base_configuration:
    path: ./data/configs/default.tgz          # file: base configuration (usually an ECS container)
  firmware:
    path: ./data/firmware                     # directory: files to copy into the 'Firmware' directory of the scdard
  hotfolder:
    path: ./data/input                        # directory: the hot-folder that is monitored for ATV/ECS files to process
output:
  merged_configurations:
    path: ./data/output-merged-configs        # directory: merged configurations are put here
    write_atv: true                           # controls whether to generate an ATV file with the merged configuration
    write_ecs: true                           # controls whether to generate an ECS file with the merged configuration
  update_packages:
    path: ./data/output-update-packages       # directory: update packages with firmware and the merged configuration are put here
```

The configured directories are created, if necessary and permissions allow that. Before the service can run, the base configuration
file and the firmware files must be provided in the configured directories. If the base configuration is missing, the service
will fail to start. If the firmware is missing, the generated packages will not contain any firmware files - only the merged
configuration.

## Known Limitations

- Comments: Reading a configuration file discards comments, so a written configuration file does not contain any comments.
